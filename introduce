%% Hello, I'm starting to have this dataset built and I'd like to record my learning and building process.

and 《海洋水文环境要素分析方法》科学出版社 to create a grid for my remote sensing oceanography dataset.

and I want to learn the GridBuilder software from this website:https://austides.com/downloads/. 
Today I want to finish the reading of the tutorial pdf of GridBuilder software(https://austides.com/wp-content/uploads/GridBuilder-v0.99.pdf) while using the software step by step. and this Friday I can teach others to do this.
one question: while installing the GridBuilder software, why does it ask me to install a Matlab runtime part, should I put this into the same folder with my own Matlab software? IDK, I just installed it to the C disk, not my own MATLAB folder. (OK I asked ChatGPT and it told me to separate in case of a Matlab version conflict. I was right!)

question: "Hint: Metrics highlighted in red indicate that they are outside the usually accepted range of values for a stable grid." how can I deal with this issue? how can I get a stable grid?
ChatGPT said maybe need to adjust the resolution or something but I still don't know the meaning of Grid Metrics and I will continue reading.

Q: why can't import my own data to GridBuilder software to create my own grid?

give up on the GridBuilder and transfer to Matlab again. (imports of GridBuilder need fully structured)

try matlab中读取经纬度txt生成kml文件, to generate a ROI file to download remote sensing images from sentinel website.

【！！！】done with the ROI, is the area.kml, upload this ROI file to https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/browser/?zoom=6&lat=20.69446&lng=156.76392&themeId=DEFAULT-THEME&visualizationUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsh.dataspace.copernicus.eu%2Fogc%2Fwms%2Fa91f72b5-f393-4320-bc0f-990129bd9e63&datasetId=S2_L2A_CDAS
and download all the covering satellite images tomorrow.
