%% Hello, I'm starting to have this dataset built and I'd like to record my learning and building process.
------------------------------------------11.28---------------------------------------------------------------------------
using 1.https://mbd.baidu.com/ug_share/mbox/4a83aa9e65/share?product=smartapp&tk=5b524d2f779fd51930ca8422b34fca6a&share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fyebd1h.smartapps.cn%2Fpages%2Fblog%2Findex%3FblogId%3D134068456%26_swebfr%3D1%26_swebFromHost%3Dbaiduboxapp&domain=mbd.baidu.com
2.https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv21776088/
and 《海洋水文环境要素分析方法》科学出版社 to create a grid for my remote sensing oceanography dataset.

and I want to learn the GridBuilder software from this website:https://austides.com/downloads/. 
Today I want to finish the reading of the tutorial pdf of GridBuilder software(https://austides.com/wp-content/uploads/GridBuilder-v0.99.pdf) while using the software step by step. and this Friday I can teach others to do this.
one question: while installing the GridBuilder software, why does it ask me to install a Matlab runtime part, should I put this into the same folder with my own Matlab software? IDK, I just installed it to the C disk, not my own MATLAB folder. (OK I asked ChatGPT and it told me to separate in case of a Matlab version conflict. I was right!)

question: "Hint: Metrics highlighted in red indicate that they are outside the usually accepted range of values for a stable grid." how can I deal with this issue? how can I get a stable grid?
ChatGPT said maybe need to adjust the resolution or something but I still don't know the meaning of Grid Metrics and I will continue reading.

Q: why can't import my own data to GridBuilder software to create my own grid?

give up on the GridBuilder and transfer to Matlab again. (imports of GridBuilder need fully structured)

try matlab中读取经纬度txt生成kml文件, to generate an ROI file to download remote sensing images from sentinel website.

【！！！】done with the ROI, is the area.kml, upload this ROI file to https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/browser/?zoom=6&lat=20.69446&lng=156.76392&themeId=DEFAULT-THEME&visualizationUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsh.dataspace.copernicus.eu%2Fogc%2Fwms%2Fa91f72b5-f393-4320-bc0f-990129bd9e63&datasetId=S2_L2A_CDAS
and download all the covering satellite images tomorrow.
------------------------------------------11.29---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.download some pieces of sentinel images and search for retrieval methods.
download 6 L1C several files.11.22-11.24 covering M2.
2. find out the differences between L1C and L2A
Level-1C: 经正射校正和亚像元级几何精校正后的大气表观反射率产品。
Level-2A: 主要包含经过大气校正的大气底层反射率数据
(来源：https://blog.csdn.net/YW_remote/article/details/119416610)
3. learn software operation step by step
(ori--https://blog.csdn.net/Knight_076/article/details/115339050)
4. download sen2Cor and get 6 L2A files
（download and manual:https://step.esa.int/main/snap-supported-plugins/sen2cor/sen2cor-v2-11/）
while download, study the SNAP software
learn:
Sen2cor:Sentinel-2 L2A产品生成和格式化处理器:它对L1C级大气输入数据进行大气、地形和卷云校正。Sen2Cor创建底部大气，可选地形和卷云校正反射图像，此外，还会创建气溶胶光学厚度，水汽，场景分类地图和带有质量指标性质的云和雪概率掩膜图像。其输出的产品格式和L1C级用户产品格式相同:JPEG 2000格式图像，三种不同的分辨率，60、20和10 m。。
Sen2Three:一个Sentienl-2 L3级处理器，用于大气校正Sentinel-2 L2A级图像的时间序列影像合成，Sen2Three以某一地理区域(tiles) L2A级图像的时间序列为输入，通过将之前输入图像的所有“坏”像素逐步替换为随后场景的“好”像素，生成合成输出图像,可以实现Sentinel-2 L2A数据去云处理。
Sen2Res:一种将Sentine-2产品的空间分辨率提高到10m/像素的处理器，可以保持产品的反射率。Sentinel-2 MSI没有全色波段，但它包含4个10m/pixel波段，Sen2Res的工作原理是建立个模型，描述这些波段之间如何共享信息(即独立于反射率的像素内容)，以及哪些信息是特定于这些波段的(即像素内容的颜色)。然后应用该模型对20m/pixel波段和60m/pixel波段进行解调，同时保持其反射率。
SNAPHU:斯坦福大学开发免费的用于InSAR的相位解缠工具，可集成在SNAP中用于对Sentinel1IW SLC级产品进行InSAR处理的相位解缠)

5. open files in SNAP and mosaic
Q can't find ways to put all the pictures together in one window. transfer to Matlab now. 
6. Matlab read sentinel data
can't believe I can't find code for dealing with sentinel. so lucky I have original codes with me.
begin at the very first. go back to the year 2017 with Bishangshang code.
bishangshang is not working too. I'm not dealing with TIFF files now.
7. try a SNAP tutorial step by step
try this one first and hope I can find ways to batch-process those images and get a standard format that I can use in MATLAB.
(tutorial:https://step.esa.int/docs/tutorials/S1TBX%20Time-series%20analysis%20with%20Sentinel-1.pdf)

------------------------------------------11.30------------------------------------------------------
1. try a morning to understand how to use SNAP to batch process data. otherwise need matlab to transfer that.
haha sentinel2 is high-resolution bands haha.
sentinel1 is SAR...
use supermap to open those 6 files and contract area. and doing mosaic. nothing important but fast. I still need to do this in Matlab afterwards.

Here use some codes can let sen2 cor only deal with the 10m file (have https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/75814642)
OK I use mosaic in supermap to create a whole image with the 6 files.
now I want to read the matrix to Matlab automatically.
found a so good python code and decided to use python(https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/597807457?utm_id=0)
------------------------------------------12.01------------------------------------------------------
sentinel-2 bands combinations(https://gisgeography.com/sentinel-2-bands-combinations/#Sentinel_2_Bands)

【！！！】now the python code require a higher level of openssl, and I need to install a new openssl（download website:https://www.openssl.org/source/）.
hold it there.
start to do the PPT of remote sensing.
sentinel successful cases （https://sentinel.esa.int/web/success-stories/-/copernicus-sentinel-2-benchmark-dataset-for-detection-of-dense-marine-plastic-accumulations）
try some timepoints to see whether sentinel 2 can see the boat or not.

thank you so much,this one finally helped me install openssl:https://www.cnblogs.com/dingshaohua/p/12271280.html
【next step】install git for windows. because git has openssl.
------------------------------------------12.04---------------------------------------------------
install git already, but it seems that I need to install gitpython.
so hard.
give up on my pip install. try the conda install and the python.exe in Anaconda folder.
all well with the conda environment module installing. except for too slow.
now I almost can finish running the heading of this python file. (those from xx import xx and import xx)
the whole afternoon listening with the teacher teaching.
【next step】continue the reading.conda install -c conda-forge fiona and conda install -c conda-forge pyproj
don't know how to import geospatial
------------------------------------------12.05---------------------------------------------------
try to download a new sentinelSAT. I don't know it will work or not. I just know the current one isn't working.
try install the sentinelSAT again using conda. no, still not working.
sentinelsat is not available. the api is not working.
【next step】try some other module https://github.com/kr-stn/awesome-sentinel#data-hubs-and-national-mirrors
try to search more on STEP forum
try google cloud repository:https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gcp-public-data-sentinel-2/L2/tiles;tab=objects?pli=1&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false&pageState=(%22StorageObjectListTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%255D%22))
------------------------------------------12.06---------------------------------------------------
after 12am I will download those files one by one.
and this afternoon find a paper or some ways to draw the pictures of those images. using new ways to learn paper with popai, chrome extension and paperwithcode.
on Thursday I need to draw one or two products of those images.
I just download 1020 1023 1025 1028 1030(not all), and the website went out.
for today and tomorrow I need to batch process those files and draw some dynamic PPT sildes.
try use this one to process data(https://blog.csdn.net/lidahuilidahui/article/details/102765420)
and this one batch process:https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/91716850
【next step】continue to try SNAP batch process 
---------------------------------------12.08---------------------------------------------------
I lost my record of 1207, I read some papers and get to know 2348bands to retrieve chla.
just compare in situ value and 2348 bands value.
today morning we have a meeting together and try to summary work and plan next week's work.
and I know another satellite of our contract area on 69 reports and the near bottom currents is so low compared to the surface. so maybe NORI's research is right. current is not important in sediments plume.
and it's true 26 years later the trawl prints still there on the seafloor. there maybe no such strong currents that can take the sediments away.
and I continue to process my sentinel2 data. to get chla and  total suspended matter concentration（TSMC） and try to see if the satellite can see the ship.
and then move on to the France satellite.
I got one mosaic finally! using one and a half hours and it is. mosaic 1020 and 1023. 
【next step】 I need to remove the clouds or just extract the water body.
and then retrieve the chla and TSMC

---------------------------------------12.11---------------------------------------------------
mosaic can't be taken with different size
multi-size mosaic can't change the resolution.
so I resample the images first and then use mosaic.
resample can be done with the batch process. so it's simple.
now I resample all the bands. next may just need 2 3 4 8 and quality_scene_classification and quality_cloud_confidence.
my resample failed... all the resampled images are none value. let me try band-select first and then resample.
already done band select and resample. while waiting for the mosaic.
I found a paper named 应用哨兵2号卫星遥感影像数据和机器学习算法对锡林郭勒草原土壤表层有机碳及全氮的估算。
It says using GEE to do the image select and other things.
can I use GEE for free? so that I can solve the problem that my PC storage and operation speed are low.
done with the mosaic and next step clouds removal.
now I successfully mosaic 1 picture.
now I need to use matlab to read the mosaic picture。
first try to transfer BEAN-DINAP data into nc data so that I can use Matlab to process.
this teach us how to do the clouds removal using SNAP plugins: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7-YfrLrfjA
【next step】L1C->S2resample->IDEPIX try this way too. and figure out if using IDEPIX where can I do the atmospheric and geometric correction.
maybe I found out already. use L1C to generate masks. and L2A images to remove those masks. just check out whether L1C and L2A have the same lat and lon will be enough.
---------------------------------------12.12---------------------------------------------------
help with the document arrangement.
download some images and perfect my PPT. 
find sentinelhub that has some codes to do the water quality monitoring.
GEE：https://code.earthengine.google.com/?project=ee-1043799788
sentinelhub:https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/custom-scripts/
---------------------------------------12.13---------------------------------------------------
still need nc file to run the Matlab code(water quality)
I chose 1 file and bandselect 12348 and quality scene classification and quality cloud confidence.
while I still download files.
dealing with the code I download, try to make it work and see what I can get.
10m resolution is still too high for my PC to deal with.
maybe next step I need to try 60m resolution.
【next step】still working on the readimg.m code. pay attention to the block read(ncread variables)
---------------------------------------12.14---------------------------------------------------
still run out of Memory.hrmmm.need to use the 60m resolution.
can't believe I cannot use matlab to create and write a nc file.
try many times not working.
ok i first draw images is fine.
get the chla result of a single color.hrmmm I try a lake image and see if there's any differences.

【next step】hehe near coast images still no data. I need to run good on the near coast test data
---------------------------------------12.15---------------------------------------------------
thank you very much near coast test data. all clouds....delete and download a new one.
why 2017 data has the clear view pic while 2023 data is not.
Han told me to see the chla research parts of the EIS report. good. I have a good direction now.
It's working...TAT
this code is right. except the sea-land divide 
and the sen2cor code lose my B01 channel I will do it again.
and see the perfect images of the code.
---------------------------------------12.18---------------------------------------------------
I do it again but still lose the B01 channel...
need to use batch process and get chla.
1.use SNAP to get bandsel12348 and quality scece and cloud. resample to 60m【done】
2.use Matlab to get 60m resolution Chla.
tax and money 
---------------------------------------12.20---------------------------------------------------
waste all day yesterday.
I use matlab to batch read all the chla Cya Turb Lat lon data,
and then need to write a mosaic code.
ok done a mosaic code.
next use m_map to draw a m_map pic.
use this step:https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_39509073/article/details/113247019?ops_request_misc=&request_id=&biz_id=102&utm_term=m_map&utm_medium=distribute.pc_search_result.none-task-blog-2~all~sobaiduweb~default-1-113247019.142^v96^pc_search_result_base4&spm=1018.2226.3001.4187
【next step】no good chl-a pic now.
---------------------------------------12.22---------------------------------------------------
why? what did I do yesterday.
m_scatter is wrong.can't give the whole Chla pic.
and I watched videoes at noon. no efficiency.
how can I get good chla pic.
IT‘S WORKING！
JUST m_pcolor(lon,lat,Chl_a) is working...
so simple ...
I now finish mosaic automatically. solve the problem when 2 pics overlap then disappear one. just because overlap places I use the average value and one of them is nan. so the results are nan too. disappear .
now is 0.0006 degree resolution Chl_a.
I need to write a step-by-step tutorial.

1.upload M2.kml as ROI, download data inside ROI. get S2 L1C data.
2. use sen2cor code transfer L1C to L2A
3. bandselect 12348 and quality scene + quality cloud, and resample to 60m, and saves .nc files. This step uses SNAP and its batch function(E:\sentinel2023\bandsel12348\myGraphbandsel12348sclResample). use product factory can batch import data to SNAP.
4. use mainFun_getChla.m to get corresponding lat/lon/Chla/Cya/Turb. all into one mat file.
5.put the 4+6 (gap 3 days) = 10 mats into one folder.
6.use mosaic_chl.m(the lat/lon/chla range  is manually defined), input the folder address to get and save the whole chla pic and mat(10 pics mosaic). save to the folder. The mat have lat, lon, whole_chla data. 3 columns.
7.done.

【next step】save a mosaic_chl_only.m and modify to save Cya/Turb too. all in one code.
I can see the POC 4/9 km data: https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/resources/atbd/sst/#sec_6 6-Data Access.
download the 4/9km Chl_a and Turb data.(E:\sentinel2023\MODIS_chla_daily\下载地址.txt)

I draw data distribution and latlon pics and get whole area chla/cya/turb.
【next step】process more data and compare with the MODIS data.
---------------------------------------12.28---------------------------------------------------
done with all the S1AL1C files. today other S1BL1C  files.done with all the files.
---------------------------------------12.29---------------------------------------------------
to the next year, use SNAP to bandselect 12348 and scl.
