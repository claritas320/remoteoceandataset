%% Hello, I'm starting to have this dataset built and I'd like to record my learning and building process.

using 1.https://mbd.baidu.com/ug_share/mbox/4a83aa9e65/share?product=smartapp&tk=5b524d2f779fd51930ca8422b34fca6a&share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fyebd1h.smartapps.cn%2Fpages%2Fblog%2Findex%3FblogId%3D134068456%26_swebfr%3D1%26_swebFromHost%3Dbaiduboxapp&domain=mbd.baidu.com
2.https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv21776088/
and 《海洋水文环境要素分析方法》科学出版社 to create a grid for my remote sensing oceanography dataset.

and I want to learn the GridBuilder software from this website:https://austides.com/downloads/. 
Today I want to finish the reading of the tutorial pdf of GridBuilder software(https://austides.com/wp-content/uploads/GridBuilder-v0.99.pdf) while using the software step by step. and this Friday I can teach others to do this.
one question: while installing the GridBuilder software, why does it ask me to install a Matlab runtime part, should I put this into the same folder with my own Matlab software? IDK, I just installed it to the C disk, not my own MATLAB folder. (OK I asked ChatGPT and it told me to separate in case of a Matlab version conflict. I was right!)

question: "Hint: Metrics highlighted in red indicate that they are outside the usually accepted range of values for a stable grid." how can I deal with this issue? how can I get a stable grid?
ChatGPT said maybe need to adjust the resolution or something but I still don't know the meaning of Grid Metrics and I will continue reading.

Q: why can't import my own data to GridBuilder software to create my own grid?

give up on the GridBuilder and transfer to Matlab again. (imports of GridBuilder need fully structured)

try matlab中读取经纬度txt生成kml文件, to generate an ROI file to download remote sensing images from sentinel website.

【！！！】done with the ROI, is the area.kml, upload this ROI file to https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/browser/?zoom=6&lat=20.69446&lng=156.76392&themeId=DEFAULT-THEME&visualizationUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsh.dataspace.copernicus.eu%2Fogc%2Fwms%2Fa91f72b5-f393-4320-bc0f-990129bd9e63&datasetId=S2_L2A_CDAS
and download all the covering satellite images tomorrow.
------------------------------------------11.29---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.download some pieces of sentinel images and search for retrieval methods.
download 6 L1C several files.11.22-11.24 covering M2.
2. find out the differences between L1C and L2A
Level-1C: 经正射校正和亚像元级几何精校正后的大气表观反射率产品。
Level-2A: 主要包含经过大气校正的大气底层反射率数据
(来源：https://blog.csdn.net/YW_remote/article/details/119416610)
3. learn software operation step by step
(ori--https://blog.csdn.net/Knight_076/article/details/115339050)
4. download sen2Cor and get 6 L2A files
（download and manual:https://step.esa.int/main/snap-supported-plugins/sen2cor/sen2cor-v2-11/）
while download, study the SNAP software
learn:
Sen2cor:Sentinel-2 L2A产品生成和格式化处理器:它对L1C级大气输入数据进行大气、地形和卷云校正。Sen2Cor创建底部大气，可选地形和卷云校正反射图像，此外，还会创建气溶胶光学厚度，水汽，场景分类地图和带有质量指标性质的云和雪概率掩膜图像。其输出的产品格式和L1C级用户产品格式相同:JPEG 2000格式图像，三种不同的分辨率，60、20和10 m。。
Sen2Three:一个Sentienl-2 L3级处理器，用于大气校正Sentinel-2 L2A级图像的时间序列影像合成，Sen2Three以某一地理区域(tiles) L2A级图像的时间序列为输入，通过将之前输入图像的所有“坏”像素逐步替换为随后场景的“好”像素，生成合成输出图像,可以实现Sentinel-2 L2A数据去云处理。
Sen2Res:一种将Sentine-2产品的空间分辨率提高到10m/像素的处理器，可以保持产品的反射率。Sentinel-2 MSI没有全色波段，但它包含4个10m/pixel波段，Sen2Res的工作原理是建立个模型，描述这些波段之间如何共享信息(即独立于反射率的像素内容)，以及哪些信息是特定于这些波段的(即像素内容的颜色)。然后应用该模型对20m/pixel波段和60m/pixel波段进行解调，同时保持其反射率。
SNAPHU:斯坦福大学开发免费的用于InSAR的相位解缠工具，可集成在SNAP中用于对Sentinel1IW SLC级产品进行InSAR处理的相位解缠)

5. open files in SNAP and mosaic
Q can't find ways to put all the pictures together in one window. transfer to Matlab now. 
6. Matlab read sentinel data
can't believe I can't find code for dealing with sentinel. so lucky I have original codes with me.
begin at the very first. go back to the year 2017 with Bishangshang code.
bishangshang is not working too. I'm not dealing with TIFF files now.
7. try a SNAP tutorial step by step
try this one first and hope I can find ways to batch-process those images and get a standard format that I can use in MATLAB.
(tutorial:https://step.esa.int/docs/tutorials/S1TBX%20Time-series%20analysis%20with%20Sentinel-1.pdf)

------------------------------------------11.30------------------------------------------------------
1. try a morning to understand how to use SNAP to batch process data. otherwise need matlab to transfer that.
haha sentinel2 is high-resolution bands haha.
sentinel1 is SAR...
use supermap to open those 6 files and contract area. and doing mosaic. nothing important but fast. I still need to do this in Matlab afterwards.

Here use some codes can let sen2 cor only deal with the 10m file (have https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/75814642)
OK I use mosaic in supermap to create a whole image with the 6 files.
now I want to read the matrix to Matlab automatically.
found a so good python code and decided to use python(https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/597807457?utm_id=0)
------------------------------------------12.01------------------------------------------------------
sentinel-2 bands combinations(https://gisgeography.com/sentinel-2-bands-combinations/#Sentinel_2_Bands)

【！！！】now the python code require a higher level of openssl, and I need to install a new openssl（download website:https://www.openssl.org/source/）.
hold it there.
start to do the PPT of remote sensing.
sentinel successful cases （https://sentinel.esa.int/web/success-stories/-/copernicus-sentinel-2-benchmark-dataset-for-detection-of-dense-marine-plastic-accumulations）
try some timepoints to see whether sentinel 2 can see the boat or not.

thank you so much,this one finally helped me install openssl:https://www.cnblogs.com/dingshaohua/p/12271280.html
【next step】install git for windows. because git has openssl.
------------------------------------------12.04---------------------------------------------------
install git already, but it seems that I need to install gitpython.
so hard.
give up on my pip install. try the conda install and the python.exe in Anaconda folder.
all well with the conda environment module installing. except for too slow.
now I almost can finish running the heading of this python file. (those from xx import xx and import xx)
the whole afternoon listening with the teacher teaching.
【next step】continue the reading.conda install -c conda-forge fiona and conda install -c conda-forge pyproj
don't know how to import geospatial
------------------------------------------12.05---------------------------------------------------
try to download a new sentinelSAT. I don't know it will work or not. I just know the current one isn't working.
try install the sentinelSAT again using conda. no, still not working.
sentinelsat is not available. the api is not working.
【next step】try some other module https://github.com/kr-stn/awesome-sentinel#data-hubs-and-national-mirrors
try to search more on STEP forum:https://github.com/claritas320/remoteoceandataset/blob/main/introduce
